# Memory Management in C

## Overview
This project demonstrates custom memory management in the C programming language. It includes functions to manage dynamic memory allocation, deallocation, and efficient memory usage. The code is designed to provide an abstraction over basic memory handling methods such as `malloc`, `free`, and similar functions.

## Files
- **memory_management.c**: Contains the implementation of memory management functions.
- **memory_management.h**: The header file declaring the functions and structures used in the memory management module.
- **metadata.yml**: Metadata file containing additional project information and specifications.

## Features
- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
- Memory safety checks to avoid memory leaks and dangling pointers.
- Custom memory management routines that improve control over system memory usage.

## How to Compile
Use the following command to compile the code:
```bash
gcc -o memory_management memory_management.c
```

## Usage
After compiling, you can run the executable:
```bash
./memory_management
```
